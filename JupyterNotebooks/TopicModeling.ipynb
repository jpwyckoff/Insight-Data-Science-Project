       "'work life balance is usually really great  sometimes it can be stressful when projects are due in a short amount of time but that is rare  interdepartmental communication could improve in some areas technical debt and legacy products that need to be maintained and carefully contemplated with next gen projects a few growing pains integrating sales teams and new products like most other tech companies growing at the same speed there is ever evolving change and need for process improvement be prepared to work hard be equally prepared to be rewarded for that hard work managing through legacy of a   year old company transforming a company means some decisions are better than others we are improving in our ability to learn and adjust and move emps have limited visibility to long term company vision sometimes work can be tough emotionally there are a lot of customers with some heavy missions some more so than others however blackbaud does do a good job encouraging employee participation and giving back with additional pto days so this does help connect and make an impact too the large portfolio presents a learning curve but the benefits of serving so many social good customers in so many ways makes it worth it blackbaud is growing quickly and there are growing pains new processes arent fully built out and that can lead to stops and starts on key initiatives still need to consolidate all associates into one corporate campus if you dont like a fast paced environment you wont like working at blackbaud that i dont interact with all departments on a regular basis there is so much opportunity to make an impact that it can be challenging to prioritize all of the work but that also makes it fun don t believe the recent good reviews people were asked to post them by upper management to boost reviews i know this from talking to people that still work here look at some of the job titles if you cfo who makes millions in compensation is posting on glassdoor that is a red flag blackbaud is a well sized company so there is bound to be issues in communication as there is a plethera of people who may not decipher messages as others do this is a constant effort on all blackbaud employees we need manager training the managers arent bad from my experience they just need training and to be held accountable we need better communication from the top down and more engagement from the managers lead by example we arent perfect yet but at least we are aware and working on it  some groups are a great place to be others are still in flux workers anticipate annual layoffs growing pains of small company into a larger one  in there midst of transformation  technology processes frameworks recent lay offs upper management appears to make decisions in silos large corporation so sometimes there is unnecessary confusion which slows processes down difficulty getting foot in door to medium level jobs charleston company   charleston salaries the pay isnt very competitive inwardly focused on senior executives rather than employees and customers   no real cons at this time there is a confusing and non united outlook from employees on work life balance where some work around the clock others are very eager to sneak less than  hrs on a regular basis for a new person joining it is hard to understand how strict everything is because for the most part it is very chill also getting started and into the company can take a long time due to disorganization in what you have access to when you start traditional cube setup but there are several other collaborative work spaces that you can use slow to get up and running on current projects   tech debt   growth by acquisition over a  year period has its down sides still a challenge to manage and modernize a sprawling product portfolio   decision by committee   it can be slow and challenging to move projects forward when there are often many stakeholders and unclear decision making authority none that i can think of not a con in my book but as a growing tech company its a fast paced environment those who may not like change or being challenged to stretch may not like it breadth of the product portfolio is challenging but thats getting much better with technology converging onto a single platform there is not a consistent experience at the company within departments no cons from my end like many organizations rolling out something new could takes a lot of meetings nothing that isnt being actively addressed micro management you dont get promoted unless you brown nose pay is low and benefits are worse each year i wasnt going to write this but seeing the rash of forced reviews i dont think that readers are getting an honest picture of whats really going on which is what this site is supposed to be all about i also got upset reading one review where they thought the disgruntled people on glassdoor didnt work hard enough or didnt realize how good they had it thats absolute bull to be quite frank frustration permeates across teams and tenure people who have been here   years are just as shocked and hurt by the current environment as new hires employees across the board work really hard but eventually having to give   to only get   of the way is exhausting and youre tired of having to fight to make things bearable so you get jaded but what are you going to do because this is charleston and there are only so many employers a larger city or cheaper cost of living and you would have been gone way sooner notice the may timestamp on the most recent positive reviews also notice the upper management and even executive level titles associated with the reviews these came after leadership explicitly told employees that glassdoor rankings were low and asked that we write positive reviews this is a classic example of blackbaud trying to create a pr spin and sweep things under the rug rather than owning up and genuinely better themselves i would refer to beneath the shiny exterior from may     and headed in the wrong direction from may     as accurate examples of the companys trend over the past   years so the cons   pay is way below market value its been leaderships   year strategy to create abnormally painful changes in a purposefully abrupt manner these lead to large exoduses of top performers across all departments causing an expensive brain drain   support engineering success product management sales professional services that does open room up for growth for some which some reviews mention but what those reviews dont mention is this allows blackbaud to pay those incoming persons way less like  k less than exiting persons what does that do it puts you at a lower negotiating point for the rest of your tenure which in turn lowers the overall average salary of the position which just perpetuates the whole cycle   annual layoffs yes layoffs are an expected part of business but theyre not meant to be the easy button yet thats exactly how its treated here large layoffs seem to come out of nowhere do it once  okay i get it but do it   times in   years and try to mask it internally about   in   about   in   about   in   about   in   nearly   each time now either leadership is that blind to repeatedly making poor decisions or purposefully makes decisions knowing theyll have to lay people off but hide the truth through deflection and lies   toxic upper management and executive leadership your teammates are great your direct managers are great but this is a good ole boys club and only promotes yes men women up so good luck changing things because if you want change its unlikely youre in with the right people to get promoted good leaders have gotten pushed out literally just because they had a valid disagreement with a member of the elt a member who repeatedly has their bad decisions rewarded with more responsibility   all marketing no walk we talk a great talk about doing good and bringing heart but those dont align with the actual decisions that get made which are about becoming a billion dollar company   legacy products that arent being updated fast enough to stop customers from hemorrhaging salesforce and other startups are eating us up but blackbaud continues to yell were the best were the biggest its impossible for us to fail this is bad for sales trying to sell a dream that is years away from being realized bad for engineers who are pressured to build things at a pace that promotes bugs over quality bad for support who bears the brunt of having to hear customer frustrations about having paid for a product that can do x in the old database view but not in the shiny new webview they were sold bad for product managers who are strapped by understaffed teams bad for professional services who are so backed up that they have to refund clients for months of delayed work bad for customer success who cant give the customers any good news even with all this leadership wont be worried until their credit card is declined at halls this place is toxic and id run far far away until the executive leadership changes health insurance is expensivecommute to work there are really none everyone works really hard to help our clients and each other there are no cons to working at blackbaud can be difficult to navigate the matrix if you are new the salaries are not always at market value based on education and experience growing pains creating a negative culture you may notice that there is a recent batch of highly positive reviews from current employees that is really emblematic of what blackbaud is you see the company recently strongly encouraged current employees to write favorable reviews on glassdoor to boost the ratings you know to enhance the companys image there is a lot of window dressing at blackbaud and the recent activity here is a perfect example the company tends to treat its customers as adversaries not partners the contract is the contract is often said without consideration for how blackbaud may have wronged the customer the company never takes responsibility for when it is wrong the internal culture is one that lacks any accountability no one feels empowered to accomplish anything or make decisions so things are rarely accomplished even very basic tasks move at a glacial pace timelines drift execution is poor to non existent nobody seems to care there are essentially   people that get things done in the company in the pros section i mentioned employee friendly policies which is very true however these policies when paired with a culture of no accountability leads to an employee base stuffed with complacent   year employees that never leave and never accomplish anything oh and they love to celebrate boomerang employees that leave and return this is not a good thing these folks left were asked to produce in their new roles and were like nah bro im going back to the baud this cycle also leads to practically no new ideas from the outside if the idea didnt come from daniel island its not valid if you re a high performer with career growth ambitions this morass of sloth around the org will be highly frustrating and serve as a roadblock to your development should we talk about the products one of the main products is essentially sold with a bait and switch demo i hope you like the database view that you never see in the demo the web view is mostly fairy tale another product is built on ancient web technology that is not supported by any modern browser awesome stuff really theres no appetite to really invest in products the company spends an embarrassingly low portion of its revenue on rd for a supposed cutting edge saas company senior leadership essentially prints money for themselves via gaudy stock awards a couple years ago several leaders were cashing huge stock checks but there were no raises for middle managers way to lead by example oh and there are annual layoffs because nobody in leadership is capable of reacting to poor sales performance in a timely manner the same pattern emerges every year its disgraceful office politics are out of control everyone has their fiefdoms and woe unto you should you step on anyones toes especially if youre trying to help a customer silos are everywhere look some people love it here but dont let the shiny exterior fool you this place will crush your soul if you arent willing to sell it growing in maturity relative to larger organizations not a lot of work life balanceimmature management practices  clunky corporate internal systems create unnecessary barriers to your job and their mission  dont get too comfortable in any scenario the company turns on a dime quickly leaving everyone below senior management scrambling mid level managers are often shut out major change decisions leaving most employees disconnected from anyone with answers  constant changes in quota numbers measurement relief schedule territory adjustments etc it incentives you to work as hard as you need to in your current role but dont bust your hump because all your work could go down the drain at any minute without notice blackbaud is a dynamic company that is reinventing itself and driving major innovation which can be a bit challenging for those who dont like change very few but some growing pains that are to be expected politics abound at the higher levels expectations and pace vs the reality of resources and funding are at odds power is maintained mostly by males at the very highest levels although more females are starting to play in their sandbox lots of changes over the last few years but needed provide more classes for skill growth the building is massive and i got lost a few times no cons other than that we have a large portfolio of products the learning curve isnt impossible but can be steep expect to be challenged it can be challenging to start lower in the company hierarchy and progress through the organization at senior levels pay could be more competitive way too many meetings tough to get things accomplished traffic on   is horrible advancement opportunities are limited at times but mitigated by opportunities to move across other sections of the company both horizontally and vertically pay is not in line with industry standard salary could be more aligned and competitive compared to the market the office seating layout seems to change every few months not a big deal but some what annoying plenty of qualified individuals are looking for steady employment in charleston so they dont have to pay top band rates to stay competitive with that said the benefits are solid i currently work remote so i miss out on the day to day interaction with co workers i truly do not know any cons or i would not have been there for   years there are too many people who have been set in their ways too long middle management needs to work for the greater good the con is also a pro which is change it occurs frequently and all for a good reason to succeed you need to be on board and ready to adjust to the changing needs of the business cons of any typical software environment fast paced and high performing culture has a broad and complex portfolio of products but theres been significant progress in simplifying and consolidating to the benefit of the company and customers vast portfolio of solutions makes focus a challenge change happens fast and often blackbaud needs more diverse talent blackbaud needs more diverse talent sometimes some of the older company policies still bleed through into newer policies there is a little too much emphasis put on working in the amazing new headquarters   mid size software company so it can take a little time to understand the various internal groups   could always go faster in development of new features products blackbaud is going through a lot of change which requires employees to be ready for it and lead through change those are are change resistant may find it a challenging environment blackbaud is a growing company as it gets bigger it must work through org changes process changes and leadership changes this is pretty typical for a tech company as it grows some like the fast change and challenges i do to others it might be seem a bit challenging you have to work hard   success is not a given and does not come without effortbeing the biggest in the space can sometimes make bb not quite a nimble in decision making the competition is fierce everyone wants what bb has   market share and talented employee the company seems to be struggling with their transformation blackbaud has moved many core functions customer support implementation finance it etc into centralized teams its the right strategy for a growing business but the execution has not been great there is not a clear sense of what the appropriate staffing levels for these functions really should be and the existing employees and blackbauds clients have suffered as a result blackbaud is not pet friendly but in every other aspect is on par with any other tech company in the marketplace dont really have any but if i had to pick one the pay could be more competitive however for an entry level job the opportunities you receive after this role more than make up for it things began changing for the worst in late   the focus on the customer completely disappeared and the company implemented policies that in many cases created deep negative impacts on our nonprofit clients abilities to do their missions the elt executive leadership team only cares about the bottom line and will do anything to get to this nirvana of being a billion dollar company id be fine with that if we were squeezing pennies from regular for profit companies but squeezing hospitals universities and nonprofits is not something that i can morally support there are layoffs every january and the culture in the austin office is terrible right now my experience has depended greatly on the department and manager customer support was awful for my personality  it made me far too anxious and made me feel stupid every day ive been in two other departments though and have had awesome experiences in both can do more to internally engage and inspire employees around mission impactbig opportunity to be more of a true global company vs current us centric approach onboarding process could be better as there is a lot to learn fresh off the street so there could be a better way to ramp employees up to being fully productive overabundance of meetings sometimes finding time to do the work you need to do can be hard as meetings can be back to back all day long there are so many systems to use so learning everything in the beginning is very hard especially when the the same items are labelled differently within each system there should be more consistency across the board there are so many systems to use so learning everything in the beginning is very hard especially when the the same

areas of the company work in silows and often dont communicate which leads to duplication of effort different areas of the company work in silows and often dont communicate which leads to duplication of effort i would imagine that our cons are at every other software company as well we do get in our own way at times the pros out weigh the cons tremendously though'"
