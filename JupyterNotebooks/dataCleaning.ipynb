       "'The most tenure someone has there that is not the COO is 1 year.  Look at their blog to see how many employees have come and gone in a matter of months.  Wondering the reason for the turnover?  The CEO is verbally abusive and loves chaos and creating chaos.  He has no clue how to run a company.  Be sure to ask detailed questions about the current clients and profitability - they have never sold this platform to a single client. Company experiencing high staff Turnover Poor leadership. Untrustworthy. No transparency. Not all employees have accepted the new structure and can cause negativity throughout the office. Why does it seem that everyone is leaving a sinking ship? In the last 3 months more than half of the most competent people have left. During lunch and smoke breaks the topic #1 is applying for other jobs. What is going on that most of us are not hearing about? I can only recommend for new-comers to question the financials before taking a new job at 360 No cons here anymore. It is now a fun place to work and we are changing faster than expected.  I guess some of the people don\\'t like the fast pace change but they will get over it and get on with themselves. It is nd has been needed. Lack of communication between departments and through the hierarchy. No systematic reviews nor bonuses/salary increases.  Products are mediocre despite the advertising. Technology varies depending on department no consistent protocols or processes for any of the operations. Can be extremely frustrating and the majority of the people have lots of duties beyond the scope of their jobs with very little training. There were not any cons. Unfortunately their claims to focus on customers and employees didn\\'t turn out to be true. I can honestly say that I have never been happier to finally get out after some time here. The management makes you feel like you owe them something with no repayment with a salary increase or praise. It\\'s give me give me until you finally cannot give anymore. The salaries are lacking because they promise a quarterly variable. RUN!!!! The bonus structure is a hoax. Don\\'t a believe a word they say about the Quarterly Variable. You never get paid even close to your \"target\". It\\'s a ploy to get you to sign the offer and in the door. The lacking of HR and administrative workers is insane. They will hire and hire sales people but  understaff and over work the admin side of the business. They cannot keep an HR position filled to save their life. This is mainly because the owner is so crooked and asks these people to \"work around rules and regulations\".  Be careful if they ever find an HR person that sticks around he/she will be just as crooked as him. Most importantly take a look at how many executives this company has run through over the years. If they don\\'t agree with Ed or his new fancy ideas \"they gone\". This company has extremely high turn over. Most of the staff has been with the company less than 1 year. They have almost a complete company turn over every couple of years. Another complaint that ex employee have is they work so hard at 360 that it ruins their work/ life balance. It\\'s hard to move on after working here because no company in their right mind makes you work so hard. You will be bored at every job after this.Ed is always pushing the HR newbies to push culture but doesn\\'t want to back it up. He wants to seem concerned about the employees but without spending any of his money. Senior level management is constantly changing which leads to speculation from employees especially at remote locations. The company is at least 1 year behind in their industry if not more. CEO has plenty of ideas but no clue how to actually communicate how things are going to be accomplished none to mention at this time In every company we see things that we can improve but more than that its the way people contribute to each problem we encounter. Butwe continue to miss our numbers not because of sales team not performaing but because of the lack of support from the management team of other departments like Marketing ITFinance and even HR. Non executive employees are underpaid.  Revenue goals are achieved by firing US employees and moving the work to the underpaid overseas employees.The CEO gossips undermines and verbally degrades staff behind their backs to members of his executive team.The CEO lives on Glassdoor and forces his staff to write fake good reviews to balance the honest ones.The company does not have the ability to track revenue accurately.Most of the product is out of date.The CEO convinces businesses and people he is interested in buying the business our hiring the employee to gain information from successful companies and staff with no intention on really hiring them. Unfortunately there are cons to working at 360. The pay is below average. Raises are maxed to 5% per year based on a review system that may award you between 0% and 5% merit increase per year. Reviews are subjective. PTO policy is designed in a way that you as an employee can never win. Too long to explain here but in one word: unfair. Other reviews here are from angry employees and that is also a common element that comes with working at 360training. I have not seen a review here that is untrue: Strategies shift often work overload is a daily routine reward and praise are rare and the few people that make the life at 360 a nightmare get rewarded and praised. Competition among teams departments coworkers and executives are common. Promotions from within the company are rare. Titles change but it\\'s not the career you picture yourself having over a 2 years time. For a mediocre salary more is demanded.Employees are held at the highest expectations. They are losing people every week. Horrible employee morale. New management is worse than previous. Don\\'t know where to start. Hostile atmosphere with the thought that you might be fired any moment which doesn\\'t really depend on some solid reason. Instinctive decision making and improper judgements lead to EXTREMELY high employee turnover rate. No exaggeration but no employee would like to work in such an atmosphere where you know you can be replaced any moment now if you don\\'t meet their impossible targets in a very short duration. They literally don\\'t care about the employees false promises are common. There are a few considerate managers but the ultimate authority looks out only for the immediate profitability and since the company is understaffed almost all employees are forced to overwork. What\\'s worse? Micromanagement is the chosen path trust issues. Although the pay is good it does not give the managers the rights to be authoritative and demeaning. A few managers have sky high attitude if there\\'s any opinion difference you\\'d have to give in to stay employed. Except for those who run the politics here every other employee literally hate being a part of this organization and are looking for other opportunities to save themselves asap. Just do yourselves some good and don\\'t get harassed by this organization. You wouldn\\'t be an employee here to be respected and listened to; you would just be a resource similar to a fax machine telephone or computer. I worked as an \"IT Skills Account Manager\" for a year and a half.  I was in the 100% club for Q4 of 2015 then Jan of 2016 my largest account was taken away and the only notice I received was the someone above me sending an email I was copied on to let my replacement into the building so she could take over my largest account.That\\'s sales right?  So I was moved to a named account list for the next few months until the world\\'s most brilliant CEO decided we would move the vertical accounts because of something he was told by an industry consultant.  I was then assigned to the Healthcare vertical with very few accounts in the city where I lived.  My manager was a great guy but he was pressured to ask me what was going to close all the time.  \"Remember I was reassigned twice already.  Not much to report.\"Early in 2016 the good reps I respected in other branches started to leave and go work for our largest competitor New Horizons.  Really good reps with many years of experience and great accounts.  There is a bi-weekly All Hands company call that further drives motivation down with empty rah-rah-rah.  \"Plan and Review\" is implemented a nonsensical PowerPoint deck that takes many hours to complete the person who put it in place leaves after just a few months on board.  Becomes an exercise in futility each month to update from CRM data that never seems to match up with my records of what sold.  Never seems to come out in my favor weird eh?Mid-2016 all sales managers now report directly to the CEO.  More reps leave.End of 2016 CEO starts attending Sales Meetings.  CEO still jumps in frequently to repeat things that worked over 10 years ago that some rep he liked at a company did when calling on him.  Good people are still dropping like flies my account vertical changes again because someone in marketing decides to launch a campaign that emails my prospects that I took the time to enter into CRM DAILY for 5 days.  Prospects are blocking my emails now emailing me back to \"go to #3&*\" and \"we will never do business with you.\"  CEO starts putting pressure on my through my manager to \"close something this month\" after moving my account base for the 5th time.  Decide it\\'s time to leave. tough economy business prospects not great.  The long term prospects of this company didn\\'t look great but it does always manage to survive any bumps they hit.   Had a lot of turn over while I was there did not like that. Where to start.....  They claim to be a technology company but most of the technology hasn\\'t been updated in 8-10 years. The 6000 courses that the CEO constantly talks about actually amounts to about 500 many of which haven\\'t been updated in years.  They talk about wanting to be an enterprise company and move away from a transactional company to focus more on longer term deals but the proof is in the pudding they continue to push to make numbers and have no patience for a longer sale.Channel conflict all over the place direct VAR B2B.No raises if you are in sales just told to sell more but then the play with the compensation and you can never make more $$. I am not a disgruntled employee. I feel like that is the majority of people on this site are. They want to bash 360Training because they feel like they have been â\\x80\\x9cwrongedâ\\x80\\x9d for one thing or another. I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel any ill will towards the people that brought me on board things just havenâ\\x80\\x99t worked out. The truth of the situation is that at the present moment this is not a very good company to work for. They purchased another training company because they thought it would be similar to the training model they currently had. However the IT skills industry requires much more on the operations and marketing side.  For whatever reason they are not willing to invest in operations. In other words there is much more â\\x80\\x9cupkeepâ\\x80\\x9d and overhead with the IT Skills business. . If I had to speculate it is simply a money issue they donâ\\x80\\x99t have the cash to run the business the way it is needed to run. For whatever reason no one realized this when making the investment to bring the company over. The plan to grow revenue was to simply hire sales people and have them cold call and email into new territories. They hired a lot of Smart Senior sales people and asked them to go make it work. The problem is that we have no name recognition in any of the territories and when we do win deals we are not able to fulfill the orders. Goals are not told to employees and no one really knows what we are working toward. Leadership keeps remote employees fairly in the dark about things so no one really knows what is going on. There is very little planning on anything. We will get a calendar invite for the next day with a new initiative that no one has heard of prior to this meeting. When you try to follow up with your leadership team no one is available. Requests from operations take anywhere from a couple days to as long as a week to respond. We have lost a lot of deals because no one can answer whether or not we are able to do it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure why but Iâ\\x80\\x99m guessing itâ\\x80\\x99s because most people are checked out. You can see it even from the reviews on this site. Our HR Manager would try to get ahead of things by writing a positive spin on the bottom but after so many negative responses she just kind of quit. That seems to be a theme here good people get beaten down and eventually give up. I think the CEO and other managers do actually care and want it to work. They just donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about the industry and are not willing to be strategic in order to fix things. They donâ\\x80\\x99t have or take the time to come up with a plan and make things work they want band aids. The ironic thing is that they are always in meetings I just donâ\\x80\\x99t know what they are meeting about because nothing gets done. I have never seen such a chaotic work place as 360training. There is so much disconnect between the departments between locations between management and staff between customers and customer service. How can a place like this stay in business?!? Location could be better and closer to the Austin biz scene. Company seems to get involved in lots of new projects or spin offs which seems to be distracting but that was above my pay grade. Company serves a lot of customers and industries so makes priorities compete. I hope those of you who still work there can see the handwriting on the wall. Get out while you still can. Easier to find a new job when you have a job. - Very High Turnover- Low Morale Work Environment - Confusing Management Structure- Limited Growth Opportunity- Enforced Dress Code - Siloed Departments- Poor Products and Negative Industry Reputation Personally working at 360training seemed to zap the energy out of me. With restricted PTO no work from home days and long hours 360training makes it difficult to foster an effective work-life balance.  If you are looking for a company with exciting perks and a fun upbeat culture this is not the company for you. 360training is also notorious for turnover as you can tell from other reviews with many employees lasting less than six months under the new regime. Employees are nervous theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be â\\x80\\x98nextâ\\x80\\x99 which is no way to work. The two star review comes from my personal experience. For me I have to enjoy the place wheee I spend the majority of my weeks and multiple factors made it hard at 360training to achieve that. I was hired knowing that the company was going through a transition of being bought out. That was the sole reason why they hired me as their Registrar because the previous Registrar went with the new company. Now understand I never write reviews for anything. But I\\'ve also never have had this happen to me either. I started working and throughout the 2 weeks everything was great. Then I was pulled into the director of HR\\'s office and was told that they discovered they don\\'t have the budget for my position and they have to let me go. I gave up a job to come to this company that I can\\'t get back now. It truly shows what kind of company this is when they can\\'t even look at the numbers and preplan BEFORE posting a position and changing someone\\'s life. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid the management is at this place. I wish I had looked at these reviews before starting. Overall nothing to complain about. Company is still building processes and systems that need improving in order to deliver on customer committments Stop saying the company is improving. The employee satisfaction polls are looking so much better than the previous quarters because now the managers are getting goaled on Employee Satisfaction. Instead of  actually improving work conditions or not changing directions every few months - the managers now pressure their teams to leave positive reviews. What exactly did you gain from that? On paper you see that the employees are more satisfied while they are not. You want to pay out a Quarterly bonus on a figure that was achieved by threats and is not a true representation of reality? The facepalm here is so strong I can not believe that this is happening. Reading these reviews and comments - this is a bunch of lies. I was highly motivated when I started working at 360 - I was aware that there is a lack of process strategy discipline consistency. And I took the job anyway. The CEO is one of the recruiters and I have to admit that I felt honored and up to the challenge to make this company better.Well the wake up came fast and brutal. The employees come and quit so fast that there is no documentation of previous plans efforts or investments. Every 6 months this company starts from scratch to \\'fix\\' itself. About the lies: Yes on the books it is a $40 million company. It is like saying Nokia had a $7 Billion revenue in 2010. What matters here are the cost that are running against the revenue. It is a $40 million company that spends $40 million to get there. Employees don\\'t get their Quarterly bonuses. Vendors are not getting paid. Contractors are not getting paid. All of this is a fact!The feeling working in this leftover Albertsons-retail-now-office area is like attending a funeral.  Any idea you provide to change the company for the better gets shot down by the CEO - because it wasn\\'t his idea. Nobody that works there for more than 3 months disagrees anymore with him - they know that it is his way or the highway. I highly recommend to anybody considering working there to ask an employee out for a coffee and get one (one is enough) true feedback about the place before accepting the job. Yes you will get stock options that are vested after 3 years. Only a handful of employees ever made it that long. (about 2 did) Prior ownership and disorganized systems in the past. As I said the new owners are invested in creating a productive and efficient environment. They are losing people because management is terrible CEO needs to look at the way his other upper management treats people. As long as you allow HR and operations to treat people like they are dishonest you will continue to lose team members.  Your company has a lot of potential but you need to start treating your team members all of them like they count.  Your team members are walking around like they are walking on eggs shells and with targets on their back. The culture HR has created is toxic. This company is a mess.  The operational issues that plague day-to-day life are some of the worst I\\'ve seen; and the inability of management to solve or address any of the problems have put our company into a death spiral.  Business critical systems - like CRM and the phone system - go down for months at a time while the executive team chooses to turn a blind eye.  I\\'m not kidding half of the company went without phones for 3 months.  An electricity bill recently went unpaid at one of our most important offices - the office where most of our live classes are hosted from - causing classes to go down across the company for almost a week.  Instructors go unpaid often times for months at a time until legal action is threatened.  Vendors go unpaid including training partners whom we\\'ve worked with for years causing bridges to be burned and soiling our reputation in the process.  There is a revolving door at the executive level with senior management constantly being let go anytime they disagree with our CEO on anything. We\\'re constantly finding \"Pay or Quit\" notices posted to the doors of our offices where students and customers can see.  They outsource any job they can to countries like Pakistan and the Philippines often at the expense of the student experience.  There are two separate CRM systems which are not unified and which don\\'t communicate with each other causing havoc among account managers and confusion for our customers.  Emails to upper management asking for help and assistance go ignored causing deals to be lost and fraying relationships with customers. Constantly Changing PrioritiesLack of Marketing Materials...although that may be changingTechnology HurdlesProduct Management Hurdles this company is a textbook example of what do wrong in business. they will not survive at least not in it\\'s present form. they are not honest no one seems to know what is really going on with the company at any given moment. almost without exception all employees are looking for other jobs. Do not be deceived by planted positive reviews. Lacks leadership at the top. No strategy and lack of consistency. Everything changes too often at the whims of a few Not focused on brick and mortor business They can\\'t pay their bills on time they never have accurate paychecks and their so called \"Accounting Department\" is less than adequate! Many employee\\'s have waited weeks or even months to get the money they are owed. They do not have internet access that is consistent and they have had to send their employee\\'s home to use their own internet access to do their jobs. Not to mention that this is a company that sells IT courses?!?!?!?!?! When you become an employee they give you a laptop that was outdated about 10 years with constant issues. But yet they expect you to complete task in a timely manner with poor equipment. Communication is almost nonexistent they create goals for you to meet or exceed that are NOT realistic and set you up for failure. They have so many underlying issues and are not upfront and honest with many of their customers/partners. Customer Service is terrible and don\\'t expect to receive a return call about any questions or concerns. They leave business partners hanging with students that are very unhappy! The turn over here is terrible thus far I have had 5 managers in a span of 5 months. Where do you start?  Mold mildew depressing fire hazard office. No HR.  They hire HR people a couple times a year.  No one stays long.  Unfocused abusive CEO.  No focus on strengths of the company because CEO is always chasing a new idea.  Sales people struggle every day to figure out a way to sell inferior products because money is invested in pet projects and pet people that the CEO tires of in months.  Then on to something else.  No opportunity to advance.  Below average wages pumped up with pretend bonuses. People get laid off all the time for not performing but the C level executive in charge of revenue doesn\\'t even come close to delivering on what he promises.  You can make your goals and not get a bonus because the CRO can\\'t get his job done.  I really liked the actual work I was doing here but the demands increase every day the pay is low with no hope of getting better and of the execs only the CFO and CIO really know what they are doing and give a ------ about the company and employees.  If I could have worked for one of them I might have stayed and waited it out.  The CEO seems to be losing interest and honestly if he\\'d leave the company would transform over night. There are too many things wrong with the companty to list them all: Executives are micro-managing no strategy no goals \\'culture\\' is an empty word and although there were many attempts - the CEO successfully kills all effort on others trying to make this company sane. This companies management style closely resembles flipping coins: no clear expectations no guidance no support to employees. Instead it is \\'throwing-under-the-bus\\' work overload conflicting tasks skewed priorities internal quarrel constant turn-over...HR is non-existent. Oversees workers are pressured into writing positive Glassdoor reviews. Anything more than 2 stars is a lie. Sad thing - working at 360training will not provide you with a network of good peple. Anybody that leaves keeps to themselves where they are going: the CEO has many times calles the company to badmouth the employee. Don\\'t work there - you will lose 3 months of your career! The company will drain your time with senseless initiatives to address the lack in strategy. Depending on what book of the week the CEO is reading you will either be implementing the Rockefeller Habits the Oz Principles Six Sigma KPMG best practices or the Operational Excellence procedures. Everything you did up to this point â\\x80\\x93 stop it. You will spend countless hours attending meetings filling out forms designing SOPs and reading scripts books newsletters just to have it all go to waste next week. The attrition rate is very high â\\x80\\x93 mainly due to the constant shift of focus lack of strategy and lack of leadership. Executives micro-manage beyond belief and all the hours you donâ\\x80\\x99t spend in meetings you spend refining reports. Eventually your productivity will be close to zero and you will spend more time in meetings explaining why. Many talented creative employees have left because of this reasons. The company is doing nothing to address the high attrition. Fun fact: HR Directors last the least: in 3 years the company had 8 people in that position.This is the worst company you will ever work for. Think twice. Still some of bad behaviors remain from prior management. Lotâ\\x80\\x99s of stuff still needs to be cleaned up from the past. 1. Ceilings that are so leaky the require large coolers and trash cans to collect the water. 2. Rodents 3. Temperatures so cold that you often see people wrapped in blankets at their desk. 4. Antiquated technology platform for a company trying to be a tech company.5. Phones  CRM and marketing automation tools that hardly work.6. Hundreds of thousands of bills that can\\'t be paid. 7. At least a 50% turnover rate in the 2 years I have been here. 8. A CEO that sets ridiculous strategies that are founded on his \"conversations\" with business leaders and advisors. Strategies that can\\'t possibly be executed with the capital technology or staff on board. Strategies that his entire leadership team tell him are not possible. 9. A CPO/CTO that has no vision leadership skills or know how to be at all innovative. 10. Only 1 person \"knows\" how to do every role in the company and every failure in the company is pinned on others so they can be fired and blamed. 11. Investors and banks won\\'t touch it !! They have a lot of house cleaning to do I have not been there for 3 months but I hear changes for the better are happening This happens a lot at this company from what the other employees say - most positions start all over since people quit/get laid off all the time.Everybody starts over basically. In terms of actually learning something about your job or advancing your career - it just isn\\'t happening. A huge waste of time. I do not have any Cons.  I love working here! Smells like a dump cheap operation management team are clueless CEO is toxic. Management lied right from the start.  When I asked specifically what I should expect to make my first year they kind of exaggerated in the tune of about 50k.  Product is outdated.  Even thought there are â\\x80\\x9csales territoriesâ\\x80\\x9d that does not seem to matter.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a free for all.  No reprimanding of any sort.  Infact you are rewarded when you are able to steal from other sales reps opportunities.  The tools to do your job are always breaking and IT has their hands full with archaic hardware and outdated database tools.  Its not ITâ\\x80\\x99s fault that they are not able to keep the systems up and running full time. There are so many things but most of them are covered in these reviews here. There is also a lot that is not mentioned... The sum of it all: You do not want to work at 360. No you don\\'t. Even the people that still work there want to get out. If you ever needed a hint: Don\\'t start a job there. You will be miserable hate your life and get depressed - or addicted to pain meds.Seriously: there is mold in the air ventilation there are rats in the office the break rooms leaks water through the sealing. Very sales-type environment. Sales goals are too ambitious for this type of product and the reputation. If you don\\'t hit the numbers you are out of your job in no time. Sales is mostly over the phone then some follow up emails. Marketing is doing close to nothing to support sales. Plus while being in sales your title should be account manager because clients have their emails unanswered for days so they end up calling you. Not that you would get any credit for helping clients - just your revenue number is what counts. As much as I hate to say it - all these people fail. Nobody has started at this company and has made a lasting impact on turning around the management customer complaints finances sales or marketing.  Then they leave. Myself included - a very rough landing after flying and soaring for a few weeks. Let\\'s say you have a good idea. You know it will work because you have done this before - it\\'s your job. You are good at it. Then as you present your ideas and start implementing - the CEO gives you some input (\\'coaching\\'). A few changes here. A few modifications there. Some aspects get cut. Others get expedited and launched without their correlating items. The project fails. You failed. You try again - present ideas start implementing get modifications... From the start everything positive I was told about this company is a complete lie. They terminate employees all of the time and there is not one ounce of sorrow about it. The smart ones get out on their own within a few weeks/months of joining. HR does not care about the employees at all; they are only focused on protecting the company. There is not a single department I would suggest is a good place to work here. All the departments are overloaded and have massive employee turnover. Any positive reviews are clearly written by management and fake. - Everything: Toxic people culture and management 1.  Salary is below market share. I was promised that I would get a nice variable comp package to make up for the absurd difference.  I have seen barely half of that.2.  Turnover is extremely high. In less than a year  there have been three HR directors.  3.  Morale is extremely low which creates a hostile work environment and lack of productivity.   Employees are over worked  and accused by management for projects not completing on time. If that\\'s not the worst of it there is the constant threat of terminations.  Who could be happy or successful in an environment like that? VERY disorganized. Internal strife. Lots of bickering. Lots of people leaving enmasse! (including me) Just about everything: The shallow culture the pathetic local and corporate leadership the very dysfunctional and narcissistic people that are among your \"team mates\" and and managers. All this company does well is ruin careers you can serve here for 10 years and still someone who has no sense will try making you realize that you\\'re good for nothing. CEO and HR team is very shallow and absurd The list is too long. Had to write this one in response to a recent review where the advice to management was to continue in doing a great job by allowing staff members input. If management allowed such input this organization could truly be a company of value. Truth is management feels they are the only one who understand the business they are failing in. Management is in the weeds so badly they can\\'t see past the end of their nose. Management does not communicate with staffers. They have moving companies show up at an office on a Friday afternoon to pack up an office as they close said office. Staff members don\\'t know their office is closing until the moving company or Corp. staff member show up to close it. And yes clients are booked for classes in the center that is closed with no notice. Too much more to list but my fingers are getting tired. This is a very unstable company. The positive reviews on Glassdoor are obviously planted. Look at the number of complaints posted on the Better Business Bureau website and read the other reviews here on Glassdoor--I agree. Â\\xa0Very immature CEO with no leadership or people skills.Â\\xa0The company sells regulated content but before you pay for a course you should check to make sure that the course is compliant with regulators in your state. A rumor is now circulating that the CEO is trying to sell the company and many of us feel this is the reason everything is completely falling apart. He has no idea how to run a company and he isÂ\\xa0constantly chasing new ideas. Morale is rock bottom.There is no trust and everyone feels they are treated with suspicion. Lack of trust leads to complete micromanagement. We lose good people when they realize what they have gotten themselves into or that they cannot make changes. Â\\xa0Many people say they are interviewing with other companies and trying to get out as soon as possible. A very stressful work load severely understaffed over-promising managers and the teams will have to work overtime to get things done. Half the staff is on Xanax or other meds to keep from loosing it. This job is bad for my health and I do not recommend working for 360. I am looking for another job and I know of many other who do as well. The environment can be high-pressure at times but if you develop the skills to prioritize and vocalize your priorities  then it is very manageable. A nightmare! This company has no structure no plan no consistency. People are hired and quit all the time. The employees that managed to stay there have a \\'game\\' a list of names that worked there. This list has more than 120 names on it - and that is for 3 years only. HR has no structure - everyone is a slave to the CEO who changes direction constantly. If you disagree - you are out. People who have left either on their own or by being let go keep trashing the company.  It is hard not to when you are angry or upset.  But the company is doing many things to improve the company and that can be an easy way to ruffle feathers.   Give it some time there are honest and hardworking people who are making a huge difference. The CEO was one of the MOST unethical individuals i have ever encountered in the business world.  Lied to vendors didn\\'t pay them lied to employees fired good managers.  I cannot believe the Federal Government hasn\\'t shut them down yet for some of the \"other things\" this CEO has done.  If you see a positive review it was most likely planted.  I never put my experience at 360 on my resume i am too embarrassed and ashamed that I ever worked there. Most of the content was stolen.  It was outdated and every other day the system would go down while people were trying to train.  Atrocious company. none work at your own speed. Business can\\'t make up their mind.  Directions change by the day.  Turnover is high.  Pace is frantic. I think the CEO has ADHD. Goals are moving targets. Management is incompetent. Turnover is crazy high. Ethical questions. Before you take the job at 360 read these reviews. They are on the point: bad work environment bad pay bad outlook... HR had like 8 directors in 2 years every other position is rotating their employees almost just as fast. There is no plan just day-to-day activities to keep revenue from coming in. Vendors are not getting paid. The atmosphere is terrible! Unless you need a pay check really bad - don\\'t take this job. If you do you will start looking for another job within a week I promise. RUN AWAY! Do not give this place a second glance. You will be thankful you didnâ\\x80\\x99t waste your time here.Highly toxic environment low employee morale and just an overall sense of depression from working here. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen employee turnover like it is here. The company was literally averaging 1 person being fired a week for several months (and this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a large company). This also includes members of the executive team. No one is safe and everyone is constantly terrified theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to be fired next. On the flip side those that are really good at their jobs and valuable employees are leaving to take other jobs. What does that tell you? People are working 60+ hours a week because theyâ\\x80\\x99re terrified of being fired with no work-life balance. Pretty much everyone that is still here is looking for another job. Instability at its finest. The culture is cold. Very unwelcoming and stiff environment. Accountability is preached which is nice but not with the tone in which itâ\\x80\\x99s conveyed. Employees should be held accountable but you can have other company values like wanting your employees to enjoy coming to work every day as well. I would call the culture somewhat collaborative in that some people do talk within departments but everyone will quickly throw each under the bus if thereâ\\x80\\x99s an issue. The new office is a completely open space with zero personality (how many more articles about employees hating open office environments do you need?). Itâ\\x80\\x99s very difficult to get work done in the cubes when conversations are being had especially in the sales area. The cubes that actually do have employees in them (those lucky to have not been fired yet) are bare. No one is willing to â\\x80\\x9cmove into their spaceâ\\x80\\x9d since theyâ\\x80\\x99re either already looking for their next job or waiting to be fired. Several people also have â\\x80\\x9cto-goâ\\x80\\x9d boxes ready in the event they get fired theyâ\\x80\\x99re prepared. Dress code was business casual (yep slacks and dress shirts) until they â\\x80\\x9cgrantedâ\\x80\\x9d us the ability to wear jeans for one month. If we could prove that we would dress nice with jeans they maybe would allow us to wear jeans from now on. Talk about being treated like children. Oh and donâ\\x80\\x99t get my started on flexibility. If you want it this is NOT the place for you. Itâ\\x80\\x99s clear the executive team does not trust their employees. Limited PTO and no ability to work from home. Ever.  Finally like most companies in Austin that have awesome benefits and perks. 360 has none of them. No company wide get togethers (we didnâ\\x80\\x99t even do anything for Christmas) no social gatherings we donâ\\x80\\x99t even have townhall meetings. So thereâ\\x80\\x99s no communication from the top on whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on or any appreciation from their side. I already mentioned the other issues: formal dress code no WFH no time away from the office weak 401K matching no maternity/paternity leave no laughing etc. This company lacks â\\x80\\x9call the feelsâ\\x80\\x9d.This place is seriously the worst place Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever worked. Everyone is miserable and looking to get out. Do yourself a favor and go work somewhere anywhere else. Now back to my job applicationsâ\\x80¦ Too much change within organization without any clear direction.  Way too much turnover. This company is a joke! Starting with the management - it is a portfolio of the biggest failures in the industry: The CEO is using his wife\\'s money to run the company - before he worked as a car salesman. He does not have a college degree and it shows. Without this company it is doubtful he would find a job. The other C-Level execs: one of them has three sexual harassments complaints against him - but still works there. One has already run a learning company into the ground one has been fired from his family\\'s business (How bad are you at your job for your family to let you go?). Then the turnover. Nobody within the director level lasts longer than 24 months. No knowledge transfer. No training Everyone starts from scratch. HR is basically non-existent. Next: lack of strategy. There is no plan just a wild number of ideas from the CEO that everyone has to jump on. Worst company I\\'ve ever worked for. Bought out by an obvious idiot who knows nothing about business. It\\'s just a matter of time before the government shuts down contracts for OSHA certification. Most of the employees are looking for other jobs. This is a fly by night business who will be out of business within a year. Unethical treatment immoral employment practices and there is a pending wrongful termination lawsuit which is being filed. 1: Going through change2: Figuring out among many opportunities where the company is going to focus3: you find mix of talent good and not so good.  That mix slows things down The CEO and executive team are in constant battle for who\\'s the smartest.  There is zero structure and therefore very little execution on anything meaningful that would actually make the company revenue.  Forget about ever really making variable comp.  The failed goal structure and lack of direction means this company rarely hits it\\'s revenue goal.This is a training company that fails to provide training to its staff. Career growth and advancement is based on the CEO and Executive team\\'s personal preferences. Amazing talent walks through the door and then is set up for failure due to the CEO\\'s mentality that people should be able to just figure it out.  (Literally no training or development). Now that the office has moved my commute is a little longer. Can\\'t think of any others at this point Company need to work on employee attrition level. Whatever you do- don\\'t take a job there- especially in a marketing. It will likely be the most disturbing experience of your life... it\\'s so disturbing on so many psycho crazy levels that I\\'d rather not get into it- just save yourself from a bad experience. It won\\'t look good on your resume either. They have a bad rep out there. At first it was vendors not getting paid.  Then it was contractors.  Now employees are being told variable compensation payments will be paid out four months after they were due to us. It is a sunken ship.  Don\\'t take a job here no matter the sales pitch you are given. This website has become a battle field like Captain America vs. Iron Man. The common goal is that the company should get better and that everyone should work together. The sad difference is on how this can get done. Yes the company is in a bad place financially and the unofficial part of everyone\\'s job description is to string along vendors another month before they will get paid. Yes the company paid $1500 for positive reviews and yes the employee attrition rate is very high. BUT they are doing this to keep the machine running - of course they need employees help students and fix courses. What other options to they have to attract new workers? I don\\'t blame them.If you join 360 you will become part of either group don\\'t know who\\'s side I am on. Do not take a job here. You will go down with the ship. Where to start: The courses are old the company is constantly being reported for being out of compliance the vendors do not get paid employees are \\'goaled\\' so the company does not have to pay the variable component. There is a huge disconnect from upper management. You can speak and share your opinions however nothing will come out of it. Also zero room for advancement. I found it hard to even write this review but it is necessary to share my short experience at 360training. Hopefully this can help someone make a decision to either leave the company or not join the company. I am actually increasingly embarrassed to say I even work for 360training.com. I worked incredibly hard in college and past jobs and am constantly challenging myself to continuously grow and advance in corporate America. By working at 360 I almost feel like I have taken steps backwards. I also do not find it to be productive to constantly complain but I will state the facts of the cons: underpaid degraded manipulated demeaned MICROMANAGED (to the point where you have to send daily reports of activity to your manager...only to get racked and stacked the next day against your peers..completely unprofessional) horribly outdated systems (already this year we have had to shut down for two weeks due technical problems) unsuccessful marketing team lackluster tech-equipment (lap tops are from 2007-2009). CEO & CRO are two of the most in-genuine individuals I have ever come into contact with in my life. From the interview to the moment just before you turn in your resignation or walk out you will regret your decision.The company seems to only able to survive for 2 reasons: 1) constant cycle of employees willing to take a lower base with a promise of bigger bonus and that are hired through highly embellished numbers and 2) itâ\\x80\\x99s private so the P/L (profit and loss) is hidden.If you like rats roaches leaky roofs a cold office when the heater is too expensive to repair a hot office cause the AC is undersized poor excuses for your bonus being so small prorated merit increases worthless stock options taking on other peoples roles when they leave backed up toilets due to them being too cheap to fix the line then this maybe the place for you.When a company has a higher turnover than the McDonalds or Subway that neighbors it you know there is an issue.  The only positive reviews seem to be from overseas employees that are â\\x80\\x9chighly encouragedâ\\x80\\x9d to make positive comments the CEO a PR firm(?) or his cronies.  Normally the negative complaints come from the 10% and arenâ\\x80\\x99t accurate. However in this case the reviews are telling you everything.  Six to eight HR Managers in 2 years should be proof enough that environment sucks.  Six to eight marketing directors in 2 years should tell you no one can put enough lipstick on this pig.  Having 1 very tenured CFO through all the â\\x80\\x9cCâ\\x80\\x9d Level attrition is also strange.  The reputation within the training space is complete garbage â\\x80\\x93 poor customer services outdated content poor billing discrepancy in pricing between VARs partners and B2B.  The CEO sees himself as a visionary and compares himself to Jeff Bezos or Brett Hurt.  Whatever the latest book heâ\\x80\\x99s read (or be told about) determines the mantra of the company - The Medici Effect No Manâ\\x80\\x99s Land The Oz Principle.  If he didnâ\\x80\\x99t own the company heâ\\x80\\x99d never be hired for a director level position or higher. Incredible people are duped into working here and watching the metamorphosis of new motivated employees become demoralized is very sad. You start as the new shiny toy the CEO marches around the office introducing you as the new superstar.  You canâ\\x80\\x99t be too proficient at your job or youâ\\x80\\x99ll be sent packing.The next level for this company should be bankruptcy. Where to start? First: The office in Austin has a severe mold problem. People get sick have watery eyes. Nothing is done about it. I got sick working there and many others did as well. Then the turnover rate is super high People come and go all the time. There is little to no hand-off - so you always start from scratch. Third: The US-office does not have an HR department. HR directors come and leave fast as do most employees. Forth: There is no strategy. Fifth: Executives have no clue about the business and create a lot of busy-work. Sixth: Micro-Management is taken to a new level at this company. In short: Working at 360training is a nightmare. Unattainable goals with limited resources and executives are not open to different ideas or approaches.  They only want yes people.  Also having crazy dress policies (no jeans no polos no open toe shoes for women and much more)  controlling usage of mobile devices and no remote work ever seem like major trust issues. I have had many temp positions were I worked for 3 to 6 months to assist projects. During my time with 360 I worked on and stopped working on 4 projects - all because the strategic plan had shifted. I learned from the other employees that this is a routine at the company - there is always another idea that is better than the old one - and everything gets dropped to run after the new plan. Very disorganized very chaotic - not much stuff gets actually done. Where to start? 1. The management and HR ask employees to write positive reviews on Glassdoor. Don\\'t trust these reviews. 2. Chaos. Goals and plans change weekly if not daily. No project really gets finished. There is no strategic leadership. 3. Lies. Quarterly goals are setup to make sure the payouts are as low as possible. 4. Employee attrition is absurd.
